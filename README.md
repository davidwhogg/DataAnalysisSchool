# Data Analysis School
An annual week-long program in computational data analysis for physical scientists

## Leadership
- Dan Foreman-Mackey (UW)
- David W. Hogg (NYU) (MPIA)

## Objectives
As an early-career (PhD student, postdoc, faculty or even undergraduate) researcher
in the physical sciences (physics, astronomy, chemistry, engineering),
you pick up a bit of statistics on the side as you learn your domain science.
Maybe you even had a good statistics course.
But you feel like when you are doing your data analysis you are "reinventing the
wheel" and deciding arbitrarily between many choices for your methods and code.

We take in statistically knowledgeable physical scientists and help them build functional,
high-performance, maintainable, and shareable software systems that achieve difficult
or high-tolerance data analysis objectives.
We split our time between practical work on code and coding and code structure,
and theoretical work on methodological content from statistics, applied mathematics,
and computer-science.

## Subjects
- text editing and version control
- testing, modularity, code structure
- reproducibility
- parameter estimation and inference
- MCMC and other sampling methods
- model complexity and model selection
- supervised and unsupervised methods
- non-parametric methods
- instrument calibration and self-calibration
